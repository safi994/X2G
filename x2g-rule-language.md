# X2G rule language

The document describe the first draft of the X2G rule language for mapping XML documents to Property Graphs.  Main concepts of the rule language are:
* extracting XML fragments by XPath expression,
* generating nodes and edges from literals and the evaluation of variable bindings,
* nested evaluation of statements in the context of other statements and variable bindings.
Rules have a head matching some XPath expressions or node or edge labels.  The body can contain local match rules or node and edge generation statements.

Rules on the top level are evaluated in document order.  Nested rules are evaluated in the context of the rule containing them.
  
There is no exception handling by design.  If for example an XPath expression didn't match anything in the XML documents, nothing happens: no nodes and edges are generated by the rule body.

## XML extracting with `match` and XPath expressions

The general syntax is

`match xpath(<xpath-expr>) using <var-binding> { <body> }`

The body of the `match` statement is evaluate for each xml fragment matched by the XPath expression `<xpath-expr>`.  The `using` clause allows for binding a variable to each of the matches.  Within the body the current binding can be access through the bound variable`<var-binding>` or by relative XPath expressions, alternativly.  A relative XPath starts usually with `'.'` as in the second `match` statement in the example below.

`<body>` can be one more several other `match`, `node` and `edge` generating or conditional statements.

There is a second variant of the `match` statement not using xpath expressions but matching all nodes with a certain label:

`match node(<string-expr>) using <var-binding> { <body> }`

By this statement it is possible to go through a certain set of existing node, e.g. for generating further edges.  Further, one can combine several match expressions in one statement in this way:

`match <match-expression>, <match-expression>, ... { <body> }`

The evaluation of such `match` statement is a follows: each `<match-expression>` is computed and the body is evaluated for all possible combinations of the resulting variable bindings.

## A first running example

```
// nested match example, the second match is evaluated within the context of the first
match xpath(//story) using $s {
    create node $sn label "story" {
        // property list
        content = "$s/content/text()",
        title = "$s/title/text()"
    }
    match xpath(.//person[@role="narrator"]) using $n {
        create node $pn label "person" {
            // properties
            name = "$n/name/text()",
            if $n/appellation == "Mr" {
                gender = "male"
            }
        }
        create edge $e from $sn to $pn label "narrator" { /* no properties */ }
    }
}
```

## The node generating statement

The node statement has the general form of

`create node <var-binding> label <string-expr> { <optional-property-list> <optional-unique-clause> }`

For each unique combined value of the label `<string-expr>` and `<optional-property-list>` a new node is generated.  The generated unique node id is then bound to the variable `<var-binding>`.  If there exists already a node with the same label and set of property values, its node id is bound and no new node is generated.  If an `<optional-unique-clause>` is given, only the set of specified properties controls the generation of new nodes, i.e. no new node is generated if a node with the same values for the unique properties already exists.

## The edge generating statement

And directed edge from a node ot another is produced by following statement:

`create edge <var-binding> from <node-reference> to <node-reference> label <string-expr> { <optional-property-list> }`

Both, the `from` and the `to` clause have to reference existing nodes by the given `<node-reference>`, i.e. nodes already generated.  A `<node-reference>` is usually a bound node variable from node statement evaluated before.

## The conditional statement

Sometimes it is necessary to only generate nodes and especially edges under certain constraints.  The following statement can be used for that:

`if <boolean-expr> { <body> }`

If the boolean expression, e.g. some comparisons of bound values, evaluates to true, statements of `<body>` are evaluated.

## Variable bindings and expressions

There are three types of variable bindings:

* Path variables bound to XML fragments by XPath expressions,
* Node variables bound to nodes by `create node` or `node(<label>)`, and
* Edge variables bound to edges by `create edge`.

A path variable can be used to further access all elements or attributes by an XPath sub-expression like:

`$<var>/<xpath-expression>`

Such an expression is `$p/name/text()` from the example above, which extracts the string of the sub-element `name` from a `person` fragment.

Node and edge variables can access the properties assigned. There a some reserved attributes/properties which are:
* `id` to access the node's id
* `label` returning the node or edge label, and
* `from` and `to` representing the source and target node ids of an edge.

To distinguish XPath from node and edge variables, the later using a dot notation for accessing the certein properties, like in `$n.id` or `$e.from`.

At the moment, we expact all expression to be evaluated ot truth (boolean) or the string values.  In a later version numerical expression evaluation may be added.

## Property lists

Both, nodes and edges can have a set of properties.  Each property has a name and assigned value.  Properties are assigned to nodes and edges within `create` statements.  The values are literals or expression from the evaluation of variable bindings.

Here is a property list from the running example:
```
{ // property list
    content = "$s/content/text()",
    title = "$s/title/text()"
}
```

## Comments

Comment can be used as in C++ or Java:
* a comment starting with `//` to the end of the line and
* multi-line comments enclosed by `/*` and `*/`.
